# C# application using random number generation to create a game


## Program Requirements
Create a C# application that lets the user play the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.  The program should work as follows:

1.  When the program begins, a random number in the range of 1 through 3 is generated.  If the number is 1, the computer has chosen rock.  If the number is 2, the computer has chosen paper.  If the number is 3, then the computer has chosen scissors.  Do not display the computer's choice yet.

2.  The user selects his or her choice of rock, paper, or scissors.  To get this input you can use Button controls, or clickable PictureBox controls.

3.  The computer's choice is displayed.

4.  A winner is selected according tot he following rules:
If one player chooses rock and the other chooses scissors, then rock wins.  Rock smashes scissors.
If one player chooses scissors and the other player chooses paper, then scissors wins.  Scissors cuts paper.
If one player chooses paper and the other chooses rock, then paper wins.  Paper covers rock.
If both players make the same choice, the game must be played again to determine the winner.
Be sure to modularize the program into methods that performs each major task.

## Thoughts
I had a lot of fun making this application. I decided to use a switch for the logic. This is probably the most complex switch and case statement I have done so far. I wanted to make the game really well rounded so I added images and some form color.
